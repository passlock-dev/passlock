<!-- 
  @component
  
  Displays a `Sign in with Google` button and an (optional) one-tap prompt.

  ## Google Client ID
  **IMPORTANT**: You will need to enter your Google Client ID in your Passlock
  settings - https://console.passlock.dev/settings (near the bottom under 
  'Social Login'). Also please ensure PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID is set in your .env file. 

  ## Passlock integration
  When the user signs in, this component interacts with the Passlock backend 
  to register or authenticate the user. Passlock will handle the id_token 
  verification. Following a successful sign up event you should see a new 
  user in your Passlock console. 
  
  ## Duplicate accounts warnings
  If the user tries to register or sign in with their Google account but they 
  already registered a passkey (to the same email address) they will be prompted 
  to authenticate using their passkey instead.

  ## Custom button for better UX
  The sign in with Google code renders a button. This can lead to layout shifts 
  and the style of the button may not fit in with the rest of the site. We use a
  workaround (aka hack) by which we proxy clicks from our own button to the "real"
  google button which is hidden.
